 HTML Basics

Welcome to the **HTML Basics** repository! This repository is designed to help beginners learn the fundamentals of HTML, the backbone of web development.

 
 What is HTML?
 
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides the structure for web content, allowing us to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

 What's Inside?

In this repository, you will find:

- index.html: The main HTML file that includes basic examples and structure.
- styles.css: A simple CSS file to demonstrate how HTML and CSS work together.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

 How to Use

1. Open the HTML file: Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the examples in action.

2. Edit and Experiment: Feel free to modify the HTML and CSS files to experiment and learn. It's a great way to practice!
